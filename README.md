*A cross-platform Java desktop app that helps students, researchers, and academics discover collaborators, post and apply to research opportunities, and message their matches — an "Academic Matchmaking and Collaboration Network."*

ScholarMatch was built as a course project for CSC207 (Software Design) at the University of Toronto. Beyond satisfying the course's Clean Architecture requirements, it targets a real gap: researchers and students often struggle to find collaborators who share their research interests, and existing academic networking tools are either too broad (LinkedIn) or too narrow (lab-internal mailing lists).

ScholarMatch pairs a recommendation feed (ranked by shared research interests) with a lightweight job board for research postings and a private chat for confirmed matches. Around that core are:

* Profile building with paper lookup autofill (Semantic Scholar)
* Mutual-match connect/dislike, with a dedicated matches list and messaging
* Research postings: create, browse, apply, accept/decline applicants
* Account settings with verified email changes and password changes

## Features

**Ranked Recommendations & Matching**
- **Interest-Ranked Feed:** Browse a recommendation feed of other researchers, ranked by shared research interests, with an academic-email verification badge on each card.
- **Mutual-Match Flow:** Connect or skip candidates; a match only unlocks messaging once both sides connect, with a dedicated matches list to track who you're paired with.

**Profile & Paper Lookup**
- **Rich Academic Profile:** Build a profile with institution, academic level, research field, funding status, collaboration preferences, education, and publications (up to 5).
- **Semantic Scholar Autofill:** Search for yourself on Semantic Scholar and pull in your h-index, citation count, and publication list instead of typing them by hand.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/ui-ux/UpdateProfileView.png" alt="Edit Profile screen with Semantic Scholar paper-lookup autofill" width="640"/>
</p>

**Research Postings & Applications**
- **Create & Browse Postings:** Post a research opportunity with a title, description, research field, collaboration type, and team capacity, then browse active postings from other researchers.
- **Apply & Review Applicants:** Apply to a posting with a message, and as a poster, accept or decline applicants and track your own application history — postings close automatically once full.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/ui-ux/OpportunitiesView.png" alt="Opportunities screen listing open research postings" width="640"/>
</p>

**Private Messaging**
- **Match-Only Conversations:** Message only the people you've mutually matched with, keeping conversations scoped to real connections rather than open to anyone.
- **Persistent Conversation History:** Revisit past messages with a match at any time from the chat view.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/ui-ux/ChatView.png" alt="Chat screen showing a conversation with a matched researcher" width="640"/>
</p>

**Account & Security**
- **Verified Email Changes:** Change your account email through a code-verification flow rather than a plain, unchecked update.
- **Full Account Lifecycle:** Register, log in/out, change your password, and delete your account (and its associated data) whenever you choose.

## Architecture

ScholarMatch follows **Clean Architecture**. Every feature is wired through the same four layers, and `AppBuilder` assembles them at startup in a fixed order (session → repositories → view models → presenters → interactors → controllers):

1. **Entities** (`entity/`) — plain domain objects with no framework dependencies.
2. **Use Cases** (`usecase/`) — one package per user story, each with an interactor, input/output boundary, and a narrow `DataAccessInterface` describing only the persistence it needs.
3. **Interface Adapters** (`interface_adapter/`) — controllers translate GUI events into use-case input; presenters translate use-case output into view-model state.
4. **Frameworks & Drivers** (`frameworks/`) — Swing views under `gui/`, and the two interchangeable data-access implementations under `data_access_object/`:
   * `server/` — real HTTP gateways that call the ScholarMatch backend (see [`docs/api/BACKEND_SERVER_API.md`](docs/api/BACKEND_SERVER_API.md)).
   * `localMockServer/` — the `Local*Repository` classes (auth, profile, matching, messaging, postings, account settings), an in-memory fake used for offline/demo mode.

`AppBuilder` decides once at startup, per feature, whether a use case talks to the real server or to the in-memory offline repository — see [Getting Started](#getting-started) below.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

| Tool       | Version required | Check yours       | Download                              |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **JDK**    | 21 (not older, not newer) | `java -version` | [Adoptium Temurin 21](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=21) |
| **Maven**  | 3.9+               | `mvn -version`      | [maven.apache.org/download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) |
| **OS**     | Windows / macOS / Linux | —              | —                                       |

Both commands print a version banner — the important line is `java version "21...."` (for `java -version`) and `Java version: 21...` (for `mvn -version`, near the bottom of its banner). If either shows a different major version, see [I have multiple JDKs installed](#i-have-multiple-jdks-installed) below before continuing — Maven silently uses whatever JDK is first on your `PATH`/`JAVA_HOME`, which is not always the one you expect.

### Step-by-Step Setup

**1. Clone the repo and move into it:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Guancheng-Chen/ScholarMatch.git
cd ScholarMatch
```

**2. Build and run the test suite:**

```bash
mvn clean verify
```

This compiles every class, runs [Checkstyle](#testing--code-quality) against `mystyle.xml`, and runs all ~492 JUnit tests. A successful run ends with:

```text
[INFO] Tests run: 492, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

If you instead see `BUILD FAILURE`, jump to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) — the most common first-run causes (wrong JDK version, Checkstyle violations) are listed there with fixes.

**3. Launch the app:**

```bash
mvn exec:java
```

`mvn clean verify` only *builds and tests* the project — it does **not** open the app window on its own. This is a separate, deliberate step. `mvn exec:java` needs compiled classes already on disk (under `target/classes`), so it depends on step 2 having run at least once; running it on a completely untouched clone fails with `ClassNotFoundException: com.scholarmatch.app.ScholarMatchApp` (also covered in Troubleshooting). After step 2 has run once, you can re-run `mvn exec:java` on its own for subsequent launches — Maven does not require re-running `verify` every time, though `mvn compile exec:java` is the safest one-liner if you've since edited source files.

A window titled **"ScholarMatch"** (1318×801px) should open, defaulting to [Online Mode](#online-mode-default). If no server is reachable, it falls back to [Offline Mode](#offline-mode) automatically, so a first run never blocks on network access.

**Quick Start: download the prebuilt jar.** Skip the clone/build entirely — grab the latest self-contained executable jar from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Guancheng-Chen/ScholarMatch/releases/latest) and run it with just a JDK/JRE 21 installed:

```bash
java -jar scholarmatch-prev-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

**Alternative: build the jar yourself.** `mvn clean package` builds the same self-contained executable jar (all runtime dependencies bundled in) at `target/scholarmatch-prev-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`:

```bash
mvn clean package
java -jar target/scholarmatch-prev-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Either jar is handy for handing the app to someone who only has a JRE/JDK and not the full source checkout.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| ------- | ----- | --- |
| `mvn exec:java` fails with `ClassNotFoundException: com.scholarmatch.app.ScholarMatchApp` | Nothing has been compiled yet — `target/classes` doesn't exist | Run `mvn clean verify` (or just `mvn compile`) once first |
| `mvn test` / `mvn verify` prints dozens of `Unsupported class file major version NN` stack traces mentioning `JaCoCo` and JDK-internal classes (`java.net.http.HttpRequest`, `sun.tools.attach.*`, …) | Maven is running on a JDK newer than 21 — JaCoCo 0.8.x can't instrument the *JDK's own* newer-bytecode classes, so it logs one of these per class it gives up on. This is noise, not a failure: JaCoCo only needs to instrument this project's own classes (which are compiled to bytecode it understands), so the build still reaches `BUILD SUCCESS` with all tests passing. Scroll to the bottom of the output before assuming the run failed — see [below](#i-have-multiple-jdks-installed) | Harmless; safe to ignore. To get a clean run without the noise, point `JAVA_HOME` at a JDK 21 install and re-run |
| Build fails at the `validate` phase with a wall of `[ERROR] ... mystyle.xml` output | A Checkstyle rule was violated (unused import, missing brace, line too long, etc.) | Read the file/line Checkstyle reports and fix the style issue — the build intentionally fails on any violation (`failsOnError=true`) |
| `Mockito is currently self-attaching to enable the inline-mock-maker...` printed during tests | A version-compatibility warning from Mockito's self-attach mechanism on newer JDKs | Harmless — it's a warning, not a failure; tests still run and pass |
| The app window never appears and the process just hangs | Usually a slow/unreachable network call during the online-mode server health check on startup | Wait a few seconds for the fallback to Offline Mode, or force it immediately with `OFFLINE_MODE=true mvn exec:java` |

#### I Have Multiple JDKs Installed

Maven picks up whatever JDK its own launcher resolves to, which is **not necessarily** the `java` on your shell `PATH`. Check what Maven itself sees:

```bash
mvn -version
```

Look at the `Java version:` line in the output. If it isn't `21.x`, list the JDKs you have installed and pin `JAVA_HOME` to a 21 install:

```bash
# macOS — list installed JDKs
/usr/libexec/java_home -V

# then pin Maven to JDK 21 for this shell session
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21)

# Windows (PowerShell) — set JAVA_HOME for the session
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21"

# Linux — point at wherever your JDK 21 is installed, e.g.
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk
```

Re-run `mvn -version` to confirm it now reports `21.x`, then retry the build.

### Online Mode (default)

Just running the app with no configuration uses **online mode**: the client talks directly to our own hosted ScholarMatch server, with registration / email-change verification codes delivered to your **real inbox** via the server's Resend integration.

```bash
mvn exec:java
```

If the server is unreachable, the client automatically falls back to offline mode so a demo isn't derailed by the server being down.

### Offline Mode

Offline mode runs the entire app against **in-memory fake repositories** (the `Local*Repository` classes) — no server, no database, no real emails sent. It's pre-seeded with a few demo scholars (Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing, Grace Hopper, Demo Student) so Recommend/Connect/Matches work immediately, and connecting with any seeded user always reports an instant mutual match.

```bash
OFFLINE_MODE=true mvn exec:java
```

**Email verification in offline mode is received locally, not by email.** Both the registration code and the "change my email" code are printed straight to the console instead of being sent through Resend:

```text
[Offline demo] Verification code for jane.doe@example.com: 482913
```

Just copy the code from the terminal into the app's verification field — no real mailbox involved. This makes offline mode fully self-contained: you can register a brand-new account, verify it, and use every feature with no internet connection at all.

| Mode        | Trigger                                              | Data                                   | Verification code delivery                    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Online**  | Default; server reachable                              | Real REST API + Postgres (Railway)      | Real email, via the server's Resend integration   |
| **Offline** | `OFFLINE_MODE=true`, *or* automatically if the server's health check fails | In-memory (the `Local*Repository` classes), resets every run | Printed to the console (`[Offline demo] ...`)     |

### Environment Variables

| Variable       | Required | Default                                                    | Purpose                                                        |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SERVER_URL`   | No       | `https://scholarmatch-server-production.up.railway.app`     | Base URL of the ScholarMatch REST API                          |
| `OFFLINE_MODE` | No       | unset                                                        | Set to `true` to force offline mode regardless of server health |

See [`docs/api/BACKEND_SERVER_API.md`](docs/api/BACKEND_SERVER_API.md) for the full endpoint reference and client-side wiring details.

## Usage

1. **Register or log in.** New accounts need a verification code first — request one, then check either your inbox (online) or the terminal (offline) for the code.
2. **Build your profile.** Add your institution, research interests, and papers — use the built-in paper lookup to autofill publications from Semantic Scholar.
3. **Recommend.** Review candidate profile cards; connect or pass. A mutual connect is an instant match.
4. **Matches & Messaging.** View your matches list and open a chat with anyone you've matched with.
5. **Opportunities.** Browse open postings, apply with a short message, or create your own posting and manage incoming applications (accept/decline).
6. **Account Settings.** Change your password, or change your email (requires a fresh verification code sent to the new address).

## Testing & Code Quality

```bash
mvn test                # run the JUnit 5 test suite
mvn verify               # tests + Checkstyle + JaCoCo coverage report
```

* **Checkstyle** runs on `validate` using `mystyle.xml` and fails the build on violations.
* **JaCoCo** produces a coverage report under `target/site/jacoco/` after `mvn test`/`verify`.

## Accessibility

ScholarMatch follows the **social model of disability**: one UI for everyone, no separate "accessible mode." See the full [Accessibility Report](docs/accessibility-report.md) for a principle-by-principle status (equitable use, flexibility, error tolerance, etc.) and the prioritized next steps — text scaling/dark theme and a complete keyboard-only path currently have the most room to grow.

## Contribution Guide

This is a course project (CSC207) and external contributions aren't actively solicited, but the workflow below is how the team collaborates and is documented here for transparency.

1. **Fork and branch.** Fork the repo on GitHub, clone your fork, and create a branch off `main` named `issue-<issue number>-<name>-<CA layer/test>-<use case name>` (see [`docs/format-conventions/branch_naming_convention_eg.md`](docs/format-conventions/branch_naming_convention_eg.md)).
2. **Commit format:** `<type>(<scope>): <Description>`, where `<type>` is one of `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test` (see [`docs/format-conventions/commit_format_convention_eg.md`](docs/format-conventions/commit_format_convention_eg.md)).
3. **Before opening a PR:** run `mvn verify` locally — the same checks (tests + Checkstyle) gate merges in CI, so a failing build locally will fail the same way there.
4. **Open a pull request** from your branch against `main`, using the template in [`docs/format-conventions/pull_request_summary_format_convention_eg.md`](docs/format-conventions/pull_request_summary_format_convention_eg.md) — describe what issue it fixes, what you changed, and how you tested it.
5. **Review & merge:** a maintainer reviews the PR, `mvn verify` must pass, and any review comments should be addressed with new commits (not a force-push) so the discussion stays legible. Once approved and green, a maintainer merges it — small, focused PRs get reviewed faster than large ones.
